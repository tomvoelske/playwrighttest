# Playwright Test

## Playwright proof of concept - idea is searching for Skyscanner and then attempting to proceed through the booking flow

### The purpose of this exercise is to serve as evidence of my ability to write an automation engine, but also to learn Playwright as I am more familiar with selenium.

The goal is to access Google, search for Skyscanner, enter the website, and complete a randomised flow.

Due to Google's very strong anti-bot mechanisms, the Google part will terminate early as overcoming it is beyond the scope of this project.

#### Until otherwise stated, this is a WIP and thus may include incomplete features

I am just learning as I go, so it's very likely that I'm not applying best practises, etc.
